I have still been working on my [Pricing toggle](https://github.com/jokale/pricing-comp) built entirely with just HTML and CSS whilst utilising a toggle which I have never created before, I am currently trying to finish the styling and then get the toggle functional.

I am still working through the the Javascript Algorithims and Data Structure certification on freecode camp whereby I am working through debugging and basic data structures.
