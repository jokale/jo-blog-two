Today I will be working on focusing on understanding: 

- How to pass a Callback as Props
- Using the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount
- Using  the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount
- And continuing to work on my mock tattoo website page where I am using different  CSS techiniques whereby I had managed to embed a google map on my location page and fix the form to look better!
