I have been working on a few things over the last few days I am still trying to work on my practice side projects whilst also trying to complete take home coding tests and interviews!

After a few interviews and coding tests. Finally able to finish my [insure landing page](https://insurelandingpage-nine.vercel.app/) Which is still rough around the edges but hopefully this weekend I will be able to work on it.
