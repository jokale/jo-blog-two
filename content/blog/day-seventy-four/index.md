Its another week and I have decided to make the list of things I need to look over throughout the week much smaller to make it more realistic as I am working part time. 

- Utilising authentication
- Building React for Production
- Deploying to Now
- Deploying to Netlify
- Deploying to an Apache Server
- Ejecting from create-react-app

This journey has made me realise that there is so much content out there and it can be extremely overwhelming to try and know/learn everything because it isn't possible to learn everything all at once
