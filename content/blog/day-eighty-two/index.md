Today I will be going over : 
- Share Logic Across Multiple React Components with Custom Hooks
- Advanced React Component Patterns

I have never used hooks before but I have heard some good things so it will be good to get a better insight into Hooks 
I will also be building a mock landing page whilst I corporate everything I have learnt yesterday and potentially utilise Formnik.
