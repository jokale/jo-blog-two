Day 46! Which is nearly 50 days of code of straight learning(well nearly)
Despite being nearly being at the halfway mark it is still difficult to figure out what I should be learning or reinforcing everyday nonetheless I am still pushing.

Scrolling on LinkedIn I saw a post written by a Frontend developer listing some things a frontend dev should know which helps me immensely as I try break away from full stack and into frontend, many a post and thread would suggest I should know this and shouldn't bother with that but having a clear concsise lists makes it somewhat easier.

Below is the list I saw : 
- HTML
- CSS: Basics, Specificity, Pre-processors
- SCSS
- Colour Friendly Palettes
- Responsive Web Design
- Bootstrap
- JS
- jQuery
- PHP
- HTTP Response Codes
- RESTful Services and APIs
- JSON naming conventions
- Loading and Caching Strategies
- Unit testing, UI Testing using (acceptance testing/browser testing/functional testing)
- Git and Version Control Systems
- SEO Optimisation
- IP and Data Laws
- Web Security (Content Security Policy, Sub resource Integrity, Mixed Content, Cross-site scripting, Regularly Update Plugins, and Dependencies)


Today I will be working on :

- Working through the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/p7P5Hd) playlist
- Tackling 2-4 topics on the previous list depending on how in depth I will go
- Continuing to work on my new portfolio and potentially build a prototype to get a better sense of what the page should look like 


I will post any updates below.
