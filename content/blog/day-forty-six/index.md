Day 46! Which is nearly 50 days of code of straight learning(well nearly)
Despite being nearly being at the halfway mark it is still difficult to figure out what I should be learning or reinforcing everyday nonetheless I am still pushing.

Scrolling on LinkedIn I saw a post written by a Frontend developer listing some things a frontend dev should know which helps me immensely as I try break away from full stack and into frontend, many a post and thread would suggest I should know this and shouldn't bother with that but having a clear concsise lists makes it somewhat easier.

Below is the list I saw : 
- HTML
- CSS: Basics, Specificity, Pre-processors
- SCSS
- Colour Friendly Palettes
- Responsive Web Design
- Bootstrap
- JS
- jQuery
- PHP
- HTTP Response Codes
- RESTful Services and APIs
- JSON naming conventions
- Loading and Caching Strategies
- Unit testing, UI Testing using (acceptance testing/browser testing/functional testing)
- Git and Version Control Systems
- SEO Optimisation
- IP and Data Laws
- Web Security (Content Security Policy, Sub resource Integrity, Mixed Content, Cross-site scripting, Regularly Update Plugins, and Dependencies)


Today I will be working on :

- Working through the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/p7P5Hd) playlist
- Tackling 2-4 topics on the previous list depending on how in depth I will go
- Continuing to work on my new portfolio and potentially build a prototype to get a better sense of what the page should look like 


I will post any updates below.


`UPDATES`: 

I did end up looking over 
- SCSS
- Colour Friendly Palettes
- Responsive Web Design

As I already know a bit about HTML and CSS. 
I must say SCSS is very interesting and completely changed the game in my eyes, moving forward I may actually implement SCSS in my previous projects and newer projects.

Colour friendly palettes was pretty self explanatory, despite people think the layout and aesthetics of a page is down to the UI developer, often the task of choosing a colour or a specific font may fall on the frontend developer and it is important to know what clashes and what works as the layout and colour coordination of a page can make or break an application. Upon doing further research was I was finding several colour blind friendly palettes. Often we forget to make websites more accessible to the potentially visually impaired so seeing that was good reminder to ensure I used color blind friendly colours as well as using attributes that explain what are on the page for the visually impaired.

Lastly Responsive Web design:
I had not realised I was already creating responsive web applications through using flexbox and such alike but it is important to ensure your website regardless if it is physically only one page is responsive to the user touch and is in sync with the theme of the website and the objective of the website!
