Today I will be focusing on 

- Utilising authentication
- Building React for Production
- Deploying to Now

I have never used Now so it will interesting to see how it differs from Netlify and potentially I will use it to deploy my project 

I will continue to build my project and try continue work around firebase.



#### Updates:

It seems as though without realising I have been building in React in development mode which makes sense because when you are building a project it is in the development stages! When it is deployed it is then in the production build mode.

##### what does production build actually mean?

In simple laymans terms production build is basically your project in a compressed form so it means when we render the project on our browser  during production build we can see it quickly.

I have a [React google plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) that shows me if my project is in production or development mode. 

Added some pictures below to show the difference
