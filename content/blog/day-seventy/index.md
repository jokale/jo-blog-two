Day 70!!! 30 more days till I am done!

Today I will be continuing to look over :

- Removing Items from State
- Animating React Components
- Continuing to work on my prototype diary App utilising Firebase for authentication and potentially the backend!
- Lastly looking into Next.js (a React framework for super-fast sites)



```UPDATES :```
- Next.js seems to be very interesting I need to look into utlising it 
- I didn't realise there were so many ways you could animate React components [ 5 ways to Animate React Components](https://medium.com/hackernoon/5-ways-to-animate-a-reactjs-app-in-2019-56eb9af6e3bf)

- There are several methods to remove items from State but it depends if you want to remove it from the DOM or both State and the DOM
