Having gone through one week already I think my approach may have to change. Despite there being so many potential projects out there that I could build. I feel like I need to get a good grasp of what I am coding or realistically copying and pasting across!
Today I am dedicating to trying to complete the Javascript course on Codecademy: [Javascript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

As despite I am trying to do #100daysofreact React is a Javascript library so getting a good understanding of that should push me in the right direction. Despite having graduated from my Bootcamp under 4 months ago. Loops still get me.
