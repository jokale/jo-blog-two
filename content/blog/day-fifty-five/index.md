Funnily enough I was thinking about creating a project whereby I had to render state and I recieved a coding test whereby I had to render data from an API and use it to convert the data. 

I strayed away from using redux as there simpler ways to render state and get data from an API with Asynchronous HTTP requests and upon doing my research, there are many ways to create a GET request from fetch to async and await.

As I have been working on this coding test I haven't been doing much else although this allowing me to learn at the same time.
