Still taking a break with my Landing Page project and still been working on Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), as well as the Responsive Web Design Certification.

Its been really good for me to go through the freecodecamp certifications because it is teaching me small things I didn't know about like line heights and such alike. 

It also acts like a good refresher as well on concepts I've looked over in the past. 
Loops and Switch statements will still be my achilles heel!
