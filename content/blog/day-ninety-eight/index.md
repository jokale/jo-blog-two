Still taking a break with my Landing Page project and still been working on Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), as well as the Responsive Web Design Certification.

Its been really good for me to go through the freecodecamp certifications because it is teaching me small things I didn't know about like line heights and such alike. 

It also acts like a good refresher as well on concepts I've looked over in the past. 
Loops and Switch statements will still be my achilles heel!

#### Updates:

During working through the Responsive Web Design Certification

There was one module that stood out which was Applied Accessibility.
It reminded me I often do not make my code as accessible to those who have difficulty seeing and/or hearing. Forgetting alt tags and such alike makes it harder for web pages to be more accesible.

Moving forward I will ensure that my code is always accessible!
