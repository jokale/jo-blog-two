Officially the challenge is over but I am still learning everyday so I feel like it would be good to keep going with the challenge.

Was given a coding challenge and it was good to work on my problem solving skills. One thing I have seem to abandoned is the problem solving aspect of coding. Where I have focused soley on the problem solving design aspects. Its also good to remember despite I want to go into frontend, I will still have to implement logic with functions that alter the UI.
