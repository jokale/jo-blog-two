Officially the challenge is over but I am still learning everyday so I feel like it would be good to keep going with the challenge.

Was given a coding challenge and it was good to work on my problem solving skills. One thing I have seem to abandoned is the problem solving aspect of coding. Where I have focused soley on the problem solving design aspects. Its also good to remember despite I want to go into frontend, I will still have to implement logic with functions that alter the UI. 

#### Updates:

During the coding challenge, I was asked to create a function that had to produce multiple versions of my input. 

I came across a concept called *method chaining* which basically means repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. 
This means we don't need to create different functions and call upon them but merely chain a method one after the other!
