I am continuing to build upon my tripadviser mock website [Fly go](https://github.com/jokale/travel-app) feel free to take a look! It is currently going well and this is the part of frontend development I really enjoy, where I am using CSS and Javascript to manipulate my code and create different styles on the page or in this instant imitiate another style and add my own twist.

Once I have burnt myself out with building I will continue to :

- Rewatching some firebase videos to get a better understanding and learn how to incorporate into my Fly go project
