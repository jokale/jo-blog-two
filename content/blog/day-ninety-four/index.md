Its the weekend so I wanted to take it easy as I have built 3 different projects this week and just stick with learning.
I am dedicated to getting some certifications before the 100 days so I am focusing on working through  Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and learning more about attributes as I didn't get the chance to work on it yesterday.
