These days were spent battling a mini netflix project by scotch:

[Mini project](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mini-netflix-with-react-in-10-minutes)



Which honestly I did not manage to build in 10 minutes and had some difficulty with.
In turn, I turned to Codecademy to finish the Javascript course (despite I am doing 100 days of react).
Overall 7 days in has been more a refresher then learning anything new but understandably it is proving easy and difficult to ensure what steps you should be taking, what concepts you should be looking at. However, I hope the next week is more successful where I am able to actually complete a mini project on top of other personal projects.
