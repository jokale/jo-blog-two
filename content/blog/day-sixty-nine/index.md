title: Day 69!

After several days I have realised that within this challenge I don't need to rush through content and concepts. I can take as long as I need and if it means I need to take 3 days to understand then I will take 3 days!

Today I will be continuing to look over :

- State with Firebase
- Persisting Order State with localstorage
- Bi-directional Data Flow and Live State Editing

As well as thinking about potential projects utilising Firebase, maybe a chat app or an app whereby a user can log in

UPDATES :

- I have decided to make diary web app whereby the user can log in and write a diary entry so I can try utlise firebase authentication and sign in/log in


[What is Window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

- I didn't know local storage actually existed but I know understand it to be a data related to that specific web app/application whereby the stored data is saved across browser sessions and the data in their has no expiration time, meaning the data can be accessed at any time.
