title: Day 69!

After several days I have realised that within this challenge I don't need to rush through content and concepts. I can take as long as I need and if it means I need to take 3 days to understand then I will take 3 days!

Today I will be continuing to look over :

- State with Firebase
- Persisting Order State with localstorage
- Bi-directional Data Flow and Live State Editing

As well as thinking about potential projects utilising Firebase, maybe a chat app or an app whereby a user can log in
