Over the next 100 days, I will be embarking on a journey to learn more specifically about Javascript, React, HTML and CSS and whatever comes along the way.
Having seen the multitude of people doing the challenge I thought about doing on and off for months. But the idea of trying to learn on my post boot-camp frightened me.
Yet reading so many articles on Medium I figured that this is probably the best way for me to dive into the languages and frameworks I want to strengthen at this period of time. Due to covid19 and everything changing and being remote and being at home this is the perfect time.
Every day/week I will doing a short summary of what I have learnt on a blog that I will be kickstarting with Gatsby!

This is where I will be reposting some stuff in more depth!
