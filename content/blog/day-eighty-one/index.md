I have lost track of what week I am on haha but its a new week and I will be working on 

- Getting Started with Redux
- Share Logic Across Multiple React Components with Custom Hooks
- Advanced React Component Patterns
- React Testing Cookbook
- Use the useState React Hook
- Store Values in localStorage with the React useEffect Hook
- Simplify React Apps with React Hooks
- Add routing to React apps using React Router v4

Where today I will be refocusing on redux
#### Updates:

Today has been interesting I was able to look into redux but whilst getting a refresher I realised that it is really quite long winded and I am sure there are better ways to manage state within a project.

I stumbled across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUlwhe-kmog) whereby he mentioned :
- Formnik
- Apollo Graphql
 and much more 

He also mentioned boiler plate code and I realised I had never heard about this up until today whereby I was looking at different things about redux and the general gist is just that its super long code that be made shorter basically!

Now I am on a hunt to find good state management framework/library I could use in addition to using the local storage of a component.
