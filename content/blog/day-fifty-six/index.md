I am still working on the coding test I was sent yesterday and it is proving to be difficult, despite I have managed to render the data on the page, I am still struggling with the last portion of the test. 

Despite the difficulties it has been a massive learning curve and pushed to really delve deep and program and try and program well.
Regardless of the outcome I have learnt alot and that javascript pretty much has a method for everything and that even if your code doesn't work intially, keep pushing because it will work out in the end!
