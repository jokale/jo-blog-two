No one has talks about how hard it is to really gain motivation during a pandemic to code and create new ideas. Nonetheless I keep going. 
I am still working through the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/p7P5Hd) playlist and thinking about different potential projects.

I have a challenege in mind to change my portfolio and potentially build from scratch. I don't think I am at Gatsby starter template building level yet (I am sure I will get there eventually!)
