I am continuing working through the Javascript course on Codecademy: [Javascript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) 

Today I went through Advanced Objects and some of the things learnt :

 - How to use the this keyword.
 - conveying privacy in JavaScript methods.
 - defining getters and setters in objects.
 - creating factory functions.
 - using destructuring techniques.
