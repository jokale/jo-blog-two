I took another few days off due to it being my birthday on the 3rd!

Yes I am still working on this project just trying to really ensure the project looks exactly like the examplar project

#### Updates:

It is finally complete!!!
Sometimes you really need to just switch on and focus and get the project done.

It has been a long few days but its been a great learning experience and has made me realise there is always more to learn about CSS.

I utilised [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) to learn about CSS positioning.
