I am continuing working through the Javascript course on Codecademy: [Javascript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) which is allowing me to reaffirm the basics that I had learnt during the course. 
Today I went through Loops, High order functions, and Iterators!

 Loops are still getting me but I will get there eventually.
