I started building my Intro component project where I am just adding the finishing stylistic changes and starting to build the form validation.

I am also still working on  Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), as well as the Responsive Web Design Certification.
