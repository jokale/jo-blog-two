It has been a while since I have updated the blog!
I have found I am somewhat coding less and trying to learn more unintentionally. 

In terms of projects, I am still doing the same things where I am trying to work through the freecodecamp certfications as well as trying to complete the toggle action on my pricing project (which has been neglected!). 

Granted for good reason. I have been a bit sidetracked with coding tests/interviews which are challenging but challenges that I am able to learn from. 

During one test I learnt about [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)
which was very interesting to look into and I didn't really know existed!

In addition to this I have also been looking into [Regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) which was even helpful for one of the coding tests I was doing.

The biggest takeaway I have from doing the coding tests is that sometimes you'll really have to go out of the box of what you know to solve a problem because sometimes you just won't know about this particular method or concept!

After all the tests and having two days off of no coding I am ready to jump back into code and tackle this toggle once and for all.

Specifically today I will be working on :
- Fixing my toggle button on my pricing project 
- Finishing the freecodecamp Regular Expressions course
- Potentially starting another course on there.
