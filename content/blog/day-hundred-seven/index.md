I have been working on a new project [Pricing toggle](https://github.com/jokale/pricing-comp) built entirely with just HTML and CSS whilst utilising a toggle.

I have been slacking slightly on working through the the Javascript Algorithims and Data Structure certification on freecode camp, but I am picking it back up as I managed to finish all the content for Responsive Web Design!
