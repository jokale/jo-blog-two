title: Day 40!

Taking a break from Redux and going back to building a fake travel style application, almost a dupe of Trip Advisor if you like and I will see how that goes.

I will try and implement flexbox I had learnt the day before as well as :


- Looking over Node in more detail as a backend to replace my RoR backend 
- looking over Firebase again to try and add to my project
