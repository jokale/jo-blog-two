Today I will be looking over :

- Component Validation with PropTypes
- Authentication

The aim is to try and utilise everything I have been learning over the week and use it whilst building my diary app. I may create a figma prototype to get a better idea of what I want the project to look like 

```UPDATES :```

* A great link regarding validation of props with Proptypes [Validation of Proptypes](https://blog.logrocket.com/validating-react-component-props-with-prop-types-ef14b29963fc/) This explained why we often need to validate Props. Sometimes whilst we code away we may forget to pass down the revelant props to the necessary child component leading to malfunctioning code and bugs. Utilising propTypes allows us to check and validate the prop we are supposed to be using in a specific component. If said component has been passed the incorrect prop we get a lovely error in the console alerting us of this. As opposed to code breaking and us scrambling our brains to figure out what happened
