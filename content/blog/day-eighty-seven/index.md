Yes its the last day of the year and I am still coding!
I am still working on my four cards project as it did take longer than I thought but I am determined to complete to a good standard.
Check it out here [Four cards project](https://github.com/jokale/4comp)


#### Updates:

This is how the page is currently; 
I have created all the four cards now I just need to position them all in the correct place!
