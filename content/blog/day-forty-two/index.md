title: Day 42!

Taking a break from my trip advisor mock website and going back to my React native todo app. Pretty basic at the moment with limited styling but this will be something I will continue to work on to flex my new React native skills!

As I am looking to go into frontend development I figured it would also be good to learn about web design and what better way to learn then to just dive straight in and start building different prototypes and such alike.

This week has been a bit jumbled to say the least and I will probably follow another course on React with Redux in the following week to get back onto Redux which I am still struggling with.



Over the course of the day I will continue to :

- Watch some videos on Figma and Firebase!


*UPDATE*

I have finished trying to fix up my [React native todo application](https://github.com/jokale/TodoAppRN) adding some styling but still trying to figure out how to deploy it to somewhere like netlify and not the app store ( I don't think its worthwhile deploying to the app store lool). It is still rough around the edges however I will continue working on it.


After learning some basics of Figma, I decided to make a protype mimicking my portfolio [Portfolio prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/9QUoWPtQ2dnWBU3x8EzHGt/Mock-1?node-id=0%3A1) again also rough around the edges but I am pretty happy considering I watched a 15 minute video and started to mess around with the style!
