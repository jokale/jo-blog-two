I am continuing working through the Javascript course on Codecademy: [Javascript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) 


Also continuing to work on different frontend mockups with code to stretch my frontend skills and learn how to make my pages look aesthetically pleasing with code!

An example of what I was building through out the day trying to build out the form.
