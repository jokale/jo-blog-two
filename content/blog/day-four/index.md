I did less however was still able to get my minimum of one hour of code where I had looked at the following topics:
State
New updates in React
So what is State? Well, state is similar to props but there are some differences. State and props are both objects. They both hold information that affects what is rendered on the page however like I stated before props are passed down to components from the parent to a child whereas State is managed within the component and belongs specifically to that component.
There is a multitude of methods that relate to state such as componentDidMount() to name one! There are more for sure but I am just scratching the surface and will hopefully be introduced to more soon.
In terms of the updates to React there arenâ€™t any new features as such but plenty updates :
