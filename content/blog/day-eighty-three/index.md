Today I will be going over : 
- React Testing Cookbook (which is quite fitting as I stumbled upon it yesterday)
- Add routing to React apps using React Router v4
- Container components

I have decided to stay away from hooks (I know they can be used sometimes) but I prefer my class set up. If it isn't broken don't fix it unless its super quick and easy! 
I will also still continue to build my landing page fix it up with some styling and pick a new font!
