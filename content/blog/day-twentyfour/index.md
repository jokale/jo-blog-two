Today I will be working on focusing on understanding: 

- Watch this 1 hour video course 
[Algorithims](https://scrimba.com/learn/algorithmsguide)
Algorithims are much harder than they may seem. Defintely something I must continue to work on despite wanting to persue frontend development.

- Using Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method 
Here I learnt I don't always have to use JSX in my render method
- Rendering with an If/Else Condition
I still need to work on loops 
- Using && for a More Concise Conditional
- Using a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering


- Rendering Conditionally from Props

- And working on my mockup:
