Today I will be focusing on React and going over some basics :


With the aim of looking over this things over the week and building a Q&A app over the weekend hopefully:


Today I looked over :


- Use State to Toggle an Element
- Write a Simple Counter
- Create a Controlled Input
- Create a Controlled Form
- Pass State as Props to Child Components

As well as working on my mock tattoo website page where I am using different  CSS techiniques whereby I had managed to embed a google map on my location page and fix the form to look better!
