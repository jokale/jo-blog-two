Day 90! 10 days til the 100 days of code is basically over!
Back in coding mode! and working on another project from the 16 Frontend projects. These projects are really helping me build my skills and coding spatial awareness if that is even a thing.

I am currently building the third project in the series whereby I am creating another landing page but this time I am using a lot of premade SVG files which I haven't used before, but the concept is still the same where I have to try and build and replicate this page :

Once complete I will be using Vercel to deploy the site which I discovered yesterday seems to be very easy and fast to use when deploying static sites!
