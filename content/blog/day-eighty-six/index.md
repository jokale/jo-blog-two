Using this [16 Frontend projects](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl) link to help me come up with some new things to build some ideas.

Today I will be building a Four card feature section whereby users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

Trying to get my projects to alter according to the device size is something I have been struggling with but I will continue to press on and keep learning.
I am still conviced there is a better way to align everything and I am sure its flexbox.

#### Updates:

This is how my single component is currently looking, took me an hour to just get all the positioning correct and I am now thinking there must be an easier way to get everythibg the same size and postiion.

Sometimes pushing forward helps this looks much better

How it finally looks

I didn't actually use flexbox as I didn't need to but this was a great challenge to refresh my coding skills.
The component is static but the sign up button has a hover element.
To improve upon this component I would create another component where the sign up button can actually lead to a form where the user could sign up.

Doing this has taught there is so much CSS can do and I have merely scratched the surface!
