Another day another project...

I am  about to start building a  build out this coming soon page  for a fake apparel brand. Still the same concept of having an example and being able to build/replicate the page.
The aim of the project is to ensure users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
- The email address is not formatted correctly



This is a preview of the page I will be trying to rebuild:

This project will be slightly different however I will be using javascript as I will need to validate the form when it's submitted.

Once complete I will be using Vercel to deploy the site.
