Today I will be working on focusing on understanding: 
- Add Event Listeners
- Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods
- Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate
- Introducing Inline Styles
- And continuing to work on my mock tattoo website page where I am using different  CSS techiniques whereby I had managed to embed a google map on my location page and fix the form to look better!
