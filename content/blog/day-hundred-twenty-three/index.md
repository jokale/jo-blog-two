Today I worked on kickstarting on my new project
Specifically today I will be working on :
- Fixing my toggle button on my pricing project 
- Finishing the freecodecamp Regular Expressions course
- Potentially starting another course on there.

#### Updates:

The Toggle on my pricing component project was something I was really struggling with for days but sometimes taking time away from something and coming back to it with a fresh mind makes all the difference!
 I was able to solve the toggle issue in 20 minutes! Had I not pushed I wouldn't have been able to figure it out! 

 Here it is live [Pricing Component](https://pricing-comp.vercel.app/)
