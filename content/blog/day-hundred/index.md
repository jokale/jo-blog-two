Finally made it to day 100
I accquired the Responsive Web Design Certification! Still working on Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

Its been really good for me to go through the freecodecamp certifications because it has allowed me to go through specific things like Flexbox, Accesibility and CSS Grids. I knew there was always an easier way for me to do specific things!

I will continue coding and working on different Frontend projects.
