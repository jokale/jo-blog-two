Its another day and arguably it could be said my project is complete because I have the validation in my project working. (Check out my project here : [Base Apparel](https://base-apparel.jokale.vercel.app/))

But I am not content with how the validation looks on the actual page with the alerts.
I need to do some more research on Modal boxes and see if this is what I need to implement in my project to get what I am looking for. 

Trying to implement logic through validation has shown me I have neglectated Javascript and I need to ensure that I am staying on top of my javascript skills.

Today I will be looking over

- Modal boxes
- Javascript logic (on Code Academy)
- Attributes
- Finish looking over my project and cleaning it up so I am happy with the look
- Look over next potential project
