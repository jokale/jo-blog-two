title: Day 93!

Its another day and arguably it could be said my project is complete because I have the validation in my project working. (Check out my project here : [Base Apparel](https://base-apparel.jokale.vercel.app/))

But I am not content with how the validation looks on the actual page with the alerts.
I need to do some more research on Modal boxes and see if this is what I need to implement in my project to get what I am looking for. 

Trying to implement logic through validation has shown me I have neglectated Javascript and I need to ensure that I am staying on top of my javascript skills.

Today I will be looking over

- Modal boxes
- Javascript logic (on Code Academy)
- Attributes
- Finish looking over my project and cleaning it up so I am happy with the look
- Look over next potential project


#### Updates:

Everyday I stumble across something new that makes me release there is so much out there that I don't even realise will make my coding experience easier which is what all of us want.

From what I understand the way Modal boxes are the same throughout but dependent upon which framework/language is being used it will be implemented differently. 
For example I use react so I will actually have to install [Modal for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal) as a package so I can actually use it in my projects.
I watched two videos where one used [Vanilla javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjQ8uvAt9kQ) and another using [React framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FNqoPpNbE) which in theory do the same thing but the way it is done is different. 
Nonetheless Modal boxes seem to a good alternative to alerts which are pretty ugly!
